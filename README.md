# Nasa-Asteroid-Classification-using-Fuzzy-Logic

Classified Asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous based on diameter, distance from Earth, Eccentricity etc.,
Applied Genetic Algorithm for feature selection.
Applied discretization to bin the data, and generated fuzzy rules on the dataset to classify using Fuzzy Logic with an accuracy of 91%.
